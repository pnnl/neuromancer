### **Project Scheme: Hybrid Control System with Differential Predictive Control (DPC) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**

---

### **Objective**:
The goal is to develop a hybrid control system by combining **Differential Predictive Control (DPC)** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** for efficient, robust control of a complex physical system. The system integrates a model based on **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** and **Neural State Space Models (NSSMs)** to augment control policies, with actor-critic DRL to optimize long-term strategy.

---

### **Components**:

1. **Physical System (Ground Truth)**:
   - A real-world system with **limited access**, due to high cost, complexity, or experimental constraints.

2. **System Model**:
   - A **system model** based on **ODEs** or **Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)** to capture uncertainties and perturbations. This serves as the predictive model for **DPC**.
   - The model may include **neural network (NN) terms**, such as in **Universal Differential Equations (UDEs)**, trained using real-world data when available.
   - **NSSMs** are used to model the system dynamics and provide future state predictions to augment the inputs to control models.

3. **Loss Function**:
   - The objective function representing system performance (e.g., tracking error, energy consumption). This drives DPC optimization and defines the DRL reward.

4. **Policy Model (Actor Network)**:
   - An NN-based **control policy** that outputs actions. First trained via **DPC**, and later improved using **DRL** (e.g., PPO or SAC).
   - The policy network receives **current states** and **NSSM-predicted future states** as inputs to enable foresight in decision-making.

5. **Value Model (Critic Network)**:
   - A **critic network** used in DRL to estimate long-term returns. It also receives **augmented inputs** from current states and NSSM predictions.

### **Workflow**:

#### **1. Model the Physical System Using ODE**:
   - **System Model**: Model the physical system's dynamics with **ODEs** (optionally incorporating stochastic elements to capture uncertainties). This serves as the **system model** for short-term control in DPC.
   - **NN Components**: If necessary, use real-world data to train any **neural network terms** in the system model.

---

#### **2. Gather Real-World and Simulated Data**:
   - **Data Collection**: Gather real-world data from the physical system and augment it with simulated data from the ODE-based system model.
   - **Dataset**: Combine both real and simulated data into a dataset for NSSM and DPC training.

---

#### **3. Train the Neural State Space Model (NSSM)**:
   - **NSSM Training**: Train the **NSSM** using the collected dataset. The NSSM learns to predict future states of the system from current states and control inputs.
   - **Input Augmentation**: Use NSSM-predicted next states to augment the inputs to the **policy model** (in DPC and DRL) and the **value model** (in DRL).
   - This enables proactive decision-making by incorporating future state predictions into control actions.

---

#### **4. Pre-train the Policy Network Using Differential Predictive Control (DPC)**:
   - **DPC Training**: Pre-train the policy network with **DPC**, optimizing the control actions over a finite horizon using the **system model** (based on ODEs).
   - **NSSM Predictions**: Augment the policy network's inputs with **NSSM-predicted future states** to improve decision-making.
   - **Respect Constraints**: Ensure that the DPC respects system constraints, such as safety limits or actuator boundaries.

---

#### **5. Train Policy Network Using DRL**:
   - **Policy Initialization**: Initialize the **actor network** (policy) using the DPC-trained policy for a strong starting point.
   - **Stochastic Exploration**: Ensure the policy includes some stochasticity to allow for exploration beyond the DPC-optimized policy.
   - **DRL Optimization**: Refine the policy using DRL methods like **PPO** or **SAC** to maximize long-term performance.
   - **Reward Function**:
     - Define the reward as the **difference in losses** between the DPC and DRL policies:
       \[
       R = \mathcal{L}_{\text{DPC}} - \mathcal{L}_{\text{DRL}}
       \]
     - This encourages the RL agent to improve over the DPC baseline policy.
   - **Critic Network**: Randomly initialize the **critic network**, which will be trained alongside the policy during DRL.

### **Final Summary**:

1. **Model the Physical System**: Use ODEs (with stochastic elements if necessary) to represent system dynamics.
2. **Gather Data**: Collect real-world and simulated data for model training and policy optimization.
3. **Train NSSM**: Train the NSSM to predict future states, augmenting inputs to the control models.
4. **Pre-train Policy with DPC**: Use DPC to pre-train the policy using the system model.
5. **Train Policy with DRL**: Refine the policy using DRL (PPO or SAC), optimizing with the reward defined as the loss difference between DPC and DRL policies.

### **Outcome**:
This hybrid framework combines the short-term, constraint-aware optimization of **DPC** with the long-term adaptability of **DRL**. By augmenting inputs with **NSSM-predicted future states**, the system gains foresight, allowing for more proactive, robust control strategies. The reward structure, comparing DPC and DRL policy performance, ensures continual improvement over the baseline.
