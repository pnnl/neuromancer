## Community Development Guidelines

We welcome contributions and feedback from the open-source community!

### Discussions

[Discussions](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer/discussions) should be the first line of contact for new users to provide direct feedback on the library.
Post your [Ideas](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer/discussions/categories/ideas) for new features or examples, 
showcase your work using neuromancer in [Show and tell](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer/discussions/categories/show-and-tell),
or get support for usage in [Q&As](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer/discussions/categories/q-a),
please post them in one of our  categories.


### Contributing examples
If you have an example of using NeuroMANCER to solve an interesting problem, or of using 
NeuroMANCER in a unique way please share them in [Show and tell](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)
discussions.
The best examples might be incorporated into our current library of examples. 
To submit an example, create a folder for your example/s in the example folder if there isn't 
currently an applicable folder and place either your executable python file or notebook file there. 
Push your code back to Github and then submit a pull request. Please make sure to note in a comment at 
the top of your code if there are additional dependencies to run your example and how to install 
those dependencies. 

### Contributing code

We welcome contributions to NeuroMANCER. Please accompany contributions with some lightweight unit tests
via pytest (see test/ folder for some examples of easy to compose unit tests using pytest). 
In addition to unit tests
a script utilizing introduced new classes or modules should be placed in the examples folder. 
To contribute a new well-developed feature please submit a pull request (PR). 
Before creating a PR, we encourage developers to discuss and document the intended feature
in [Ideas](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer/discussions/categories/ideas) discussion category.

### Reporting issues or bugs
If you find a bug in the code or want to request a new well-developed feature, please open an [issue](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer/issues).
