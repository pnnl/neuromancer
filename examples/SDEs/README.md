# TorchSDE x NeuroMANCER

These folders illustrate how one might solve two cases of stochastic differential equations in Neuromancer. We achieve this technically by integrating Neuromancer framework to work with the TorchSDE library which is a library for SDE solvers (i.e. integrators). The examples in this notebook are: 

1. Basic_SDE: This is the first case of SDE problem -- where the user knows explicitly the drift and diffusion processes of the stochastic differential equation. If these are known, we can perform integration (e.g. Euler-Murayama integration which is a special case of Euler integration for stochastic case ) to compute output data at future time steps. This is similar to the torch DiffEqIntegrator examples in our library. Note that this example is based off https://github.com/google-research/torchsde/blob/master/examples/demo.ipynb
2. Latent_SDE_Lorenz_System. This is the second case of SDE problem -- where the user does *not* know the drift/diffusion terms and instead seeks to learn these processes. This is the System ID equivalent for the stochastic case. The output of this notebook will be a LatentSDE neural network that can generate new time-series samples that exhibit the stochastic behavior of the original input data. 
3. Latent_SDE_Stock_Forecasting: This is the same as the above lorenz system notebook but applied to a different use case. That financial markets often exhibit stochastic/brownian motion behavior over certain intervals is a core tenet in quantitative finance. Here we attempt to learn underlying stochastic process of the S&P 500 index. *Note that this notebook is still in development as there is an exploding gradient issue, but the core outline is correct*
