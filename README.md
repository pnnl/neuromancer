# NeuroMANCER v1.4

**Neural Modules with Adaptive Nonlinear Constraints and Efficient Regularizations (NeuroMANCER)**
is an open-source differentiable programming (DP) library for solving parametric constrained optimization problems, 
physics-informed system identification, and parametric model-based optimal control.
NeuroMANCER is written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and allows for systematic 
integration of machine learning with scientific computing for creating end-to-end 
differentiable models and algorithms embedded with prior knowledge and physics.


## Features and Examples

Extensive set of tutorials can be found in the 
[examples](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer/tree/master/examples) folder.
Interactive notebook versions of examples are available on Google Colab!
Test out NeuroMANCER functionality before cloning the repository and setting up an
environment.

## Documentation
The documentation for the library can be found [online](https://pnnl.github.io/neuromancer/). 
There is also an [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkFKz-DgC98) covering 
core features of the library. 


```python 
# Neuromancer syntax example for constrained optimization
import neuromancer as nm
import torch 

# define neural architecture 
func = nm.modules.blocks.MLP(insize=1, outsize=2, 
                             linear_map=nm.slim.maps['linear'], 
                             nonlin=torch.nn.ReLU, hsizes=[80] * 4)
# wrap neural net into symbolic representation via the Node class: map(p) -> x
map = nm.system.Node(func, ['p'], ['x'], name='map')
    
# define decision variables
x = nm.constraint.variable("x")[:, [0]]
y = nm.constraint.variable("x")[:, [1]]
# problem parameters sampled in the dataset
p = nm.constraint.variable('p')

# define objective function
f = (1-x)**2 + (y-x**2)**2
obj = f.minimize(weight=1.0)

# define constraints
con_1 = 100.*(x >= y)
con_2 = 100.*(x**2+y**2 <= p**2)

# create penalty method-based loss function
loss = nm.loss.PenaltyLoss(objectives=[obj], constraints=[con_1, con_2])
# construct differentiable constrained optimization problem
problem = nm.problem.Problem(nodes=[map], loss=loss)
```

## Installation

For either pip or conda installation, first clone the neuromancer package.
A dedicated virtual environment (conda or otherwise) is recommended. 

Note: If you have a previous neuromancer env it would be best at this point to create a new environment given the following instructions.

```bash
git clone -b master https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer.git --single-branch
```

### Conda install
Conda install is recommended for GPU acceleration. 
In many cases the following simple install should work for the specified OS

#### Create environment & install dependencies
##### Ubuntu

``` bash
conda env create -f linux_env.yml
conda activate neuromancer
```

##### Windows

``` bash
conda env create -f windows_env.yml
conda activate neuromancer
conda install -c defaults intel-openmp -f
```

##### MacOS (Apple M1)

``` bash
conda env create -f osxarm64_env.yml
conda activate neuromancer
```

##### Other (manually install all dependencies)

!!! Pay attention to comments for non-Linux OS !!!

``` bash
conda create -n neuromancer python=3.10.4
conda activate neuromancer
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
## OR (for Mac): conda install pytorch -c pytorch
conda config --append channels conda-forge
conda install scipy numpy"<1.24.0" matplotlib scikit-learn pandas dill mlflow pydot=1.4.2 pyts numba
conda install networkx=3.0 plum-dispatch=1.7.3 
conda install -c anaconda pytest hypothesis
conda install cvxpy cvxopt casadi seaborn imageio
conda install tqdm torchdiffeq toml
## (for Windows): conda install -c defaults intel-openmp -f
```

#### Install NeuroMANCER package
From the top level directory of cloned neuromancer
(in the activated environment where the dependencies have been installed):

```bash
pip install -e . --no-deps
```

### PIP Install
Pip installation is broken up into required dependencies for core Neuromancer
and dependencies associated with the examples, tests, and generating the documentation.
Below we give instructions to install all dependencies in a conda virtual enviroment via pip. 
You need at least pip version >= 21.3.

#### Create and activate virtual environment

``` bash
conda create -n neuromancer python=3.10.4
conda activate neuromancer
```


#### Install neuromancer and all dependencies.
From top level directory of cloned neuromancer run:

```bash
pip install -e.[docs,tests,examples]
```

OR, for zsh users:
```zsh
pip install -e.'[docs,tests,examples]'
```

See the `pyproject.toml` file for reference.

``` toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
tests = ["pytest", "hypothesis"]
examples = ["casadi", "cvxpy", "imageio"]
docs = ["sphinx", "sphinx-rtd-theme"]
```

#### Note on pip install with `examples` on MacOS (Apple M1)
Before CVXPY can be installed on Apple M1, you must install `cmake` via Homebrew:

```zsh
brew install cmake
```

See [CVXPY installation instructions](https://www.cvxpy.org/install/index.html) for more details.

### Test NeuroMANCER install
Run pytest on the [tests folder](https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer/tree/master/tests). 
It should take about 2 minutes to run the tests on CPU. 
There will be a lot of warnings that you can safely ignore. These warnings will be cleaned 
up in a future release.


## Community Development

We welcome contributions and feedback from the open-source community!

### Contributing examples
If you have an example of using NeuroMANCER to solve an interesting problem, or of using 
NeuroMANCER in a unique way, we would love to see it incorporated into our current library of examples. 
To submit an example, create a folder for your example/s in the example folder if there isn't 
currently an applicable folder and place either your executable python file or notebook file there. 
Push your code back to github and then submit a pull request. Please make sure to note in a comment at 
the top of your code if there are additional dependencies to run your example and how to install 
those dependencies. 

### Contributing code

We welcome contributions to NeuroMANCER. Please accompany contributions with some lightweight unit tests
via pytest (see test/ folder for some examples of easy to compose unit tests using pytest). In addition to unit tests
a script utilizing introduced new classes or modules should be placed in the examples folder. 
To contribute a new feature please submit a pull request. 

### Reporting issues or bugs
If you find a bug in the code or want to request a new feature, please open an issue.

## NeuroMANCER development plan
Here are some upcoming features we plan to develop. Please let us know if you would like to get involved and

###  Version 1.3.2 Release Notes
+ Merged Structured Linear Maps and Pyton Systems Library into Neuromancer
  + The code in neuromancer was closely tied to psl and slim.
